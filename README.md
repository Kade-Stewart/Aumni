Aumni SDET coding challenge from Kade Stewart

These tests are made to be run with chrome installed as well as java, I have chromeDriver installed in the project. Java version 16.0.1 Chrome Version 91.0.4472.164 (Official Build) (64-bit)

All of these tests pass individually but I ran into an issue with testNG where I could not run all tests at the same time. One would pass and fail the others. Running via maven only partially works if trying to run the entire sweet at once.
