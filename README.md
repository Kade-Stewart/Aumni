# Aumni
 Aumni SDET coding challenge from Kade Stewart

These tests are made to be run with chrome installed as well as java, I have chromeDriver installed in the project. 
Java version 16.0.1 

All of these tests pass individually but I ran into an issue with testNG where I could not run all tests at the same time. One would pass and fail the others.
